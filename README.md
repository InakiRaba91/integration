# Integrating and Differentiating
Explanation of why integration and differentiation are opposite operators

## Scenes

Four scenes are included in this project. Each scene demonstrates a different aspect of the relationship between integration and differentiation.

1. Derivative as slope in the limit
2. Integral as Riemann sum in the limit
3. Differentiating the area
4. Integrating the slope

In order to generate the visualizations, simply install the package and run the following command:

```bash
poetry install
```

Then you can generate the visualizations by running the following command:

```bash
poetry run python -m integral IntegrateApproximation -o
```
